# ndtm — nat does the math

One Next.js 16 app hosting eight free Singapore financial-decision
calculators under a single shell, domain, and dark design system. Every
number is traceable to a "the math" page that shows exactly how it was
worked out. No accounts; everything runs client-side except DriveReady's
own keyless data API routes.

Deployed at **https://natdtm.vercel.app**. Full architecture notes in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md); statutory-constant sources
in [`docs/statutory-sources.md`](docs/statutory-sources.md).

## The eight tools

| Tool | Route | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **InsureCheck** | `/insure` | A 3-minute Insurance Score — critical illness, life/TPD, and hospitalisation gaps in real dollars against Singapore planning benchmarks. |
| **DriveReady** | `/drive` | True monthly cost of a car — instalment, PARF/COE depreciation, TDSR — before you commit. The only vertical with live data (`/drive/api/*`). |
| **WhatETF** | `/etf` | An illustrative ETF portfolio for Singapore investors — UCITS-aware, tax-efficient, DCA-ready — generated in the browser. |
| **HouseMuch** | `/house` | What a property actually made you: profit/loss after CPF accrued-interest refund, mortgage interest, and stamp duties (BSD/ABSD/SSD). |
| **RetireWell** | `/retire` | Whether you will have enough: CPF contributions and interest projected properly, investments stress-tested against a safe withdrawal rate. |
| **TaxWise** | `/tax` | What you owe IRAS, your marginal vs effective rate, and what each relief (SRS, CPF top-up) is worth in dollars saved. |
| **MyLedger** | `/ledger` | The whole picture: net worth, debt servicing across every loan, and what a car or a house upgrade does to retirement. |
| **FlowState** | `/flow` | Where the salary goes: CPF split from cash automatically, the mortgage split into CPF vs bank, and the one month a year the account runs dry. |

Each tool has a matching `/<tool>/the-math` page explaining its formulas
and citing its sources.

## Brand history

Originally three separate apps (`sginsurecheck`, `sgdriveready`,
`sgwhatetf`) under a "Coah" brand, later merged and rebranded to a
personal "ndtm" identity with a permanent dark "Digital Workbench" theme,
then extended to eight tools. Identifiers and strings have been renamed
off the old brand; the one remaining trace is the `--l-*` CSS
custom-property prefix (kept deliberately — a repo-wide rename of every
token was judged higher risk than value). See `docs/architecture.md` for
detail.

## Design system

One theme, permanently dark, pinned via `data-theme` on `<html>`. The
palette is defined once in `src/app/globals.css` and mirrored as literal
hex in `src/lib/shared/theme.js` (components build alpha variants by
string-concatenating a hex suffix, `${C.accent}44`, which needs real hex).

- **Background** `#0b1120` / **surface** `#1e293b`
- **Accent** `#eab308` (gold) — CTAs, active states, focus rings
- **Secondary** `#ff5722` (orange) — warning / mid-severity only
- **Semantic** green `#10b981` / red `#ef4444` / blue `#38bdf8` — positive,
  negative, informational; kept distinct from the brand accent
- **Type** — Space Grotesk (display), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono
  (all numeric data), self-hosted, no font CDN

Shared components carry one visual language across all eight tools:
`Button` (press feedback), `VerdictBadge` (mono uppercase stamp),
`ExploreSection` (terminal-style "show the math" collapsible),
`ResultHero` (verdict + big mono number + plain sentence), `MathTOC`,
`TrustBadges`, and the site-wide `ShellHeader` / `Footer`.

## Cross-tool "My Numbers"

`src/lib/shared/profile.js` is a client-side (localStorage) store that
lets the tools hand figures to each other and to MyLedger's holistic
dashboard, without re-typing. It holds up to three named profiles
("Me", "Joint with Alex", …), each with a full per-tool slot set, and a
v6 schema with in-place migrations from v1. `ProfileSwitcher` in the
shell header switches the active profile. See `docs/architecture.md` for
the schema history.

## Data (DriveReady only)

Live COE premiums come from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)'s mirror
of LTA's COE Bidding Results dataset; car prices from the public
OneMotoring Car Cost Update PDF. Both keyless. `scripts/refresh-*.mjs`
(run weekly by `.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml`) open a PR against
`public/data/*.json` rather than writing to prod. An optional Supabase
mirror (`SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, CI secrets only)
receives a dual write. `/drive/data-status` shows live feed health.

## Statutory constants

Every hard-coded Singapore rate, bracket, and cap in the engines is
listed in [`docs/statutory-sources.md`](docs/statutory-sources.md) with
its authoritative source and verification date.
`src/lib/shared/statutory-currency.test.js` fails CI if that audit goes
stale. `src/lib/shared/golden-masters.test.js` checks engine output
against figures IRAS and CPF Board publish.

> **Known open discrepancies** (see `docs/statutory-sources.md`): the CPF
> contribution rates for ages 55–60 and 60–65 are still at 2025 values
> (32.5% / 23.5%; 2026 is 34% / 25%), and `SRS_RETIREMENT_AGE` is 63
> (rises to 64 on 1 Jul 2026). Fixing a constant changes calculator
> output, so these are left for a deliberate follow-up.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # dev server
npm run build        # production build
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # unit tests (node --test)
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright: page smoke + keyboard path
npm run test:e2e:visual   # screenshot baselines (regenerate on the CI runner)
```

No environment variables are required to run locally. CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, unit tests, the production build,
and the Playwright suite on every push and PR.

## Known gaps

- **React Compiler** is enabled only on the original InsureCheck, not
  repo-wide.
- **`--l-*` CSS token prefix** is a deliberate leftover from the "Coah"
  era; every other brand identifier has been renamed.
- **Visual baselines** for the Playwright `visual` project must be
  generated on the CI runner image (`ci.yml` `workflow_dispatch`), not a
  dev machine — font rendering differs.
- **PNG manifest icons** for WhatETF's PWA (currently SVG-only).
- **Engine JSDoc** — `@param`/`@returns` annotations across the `calc.js`
  modules are incomplete.
